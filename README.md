# Model Notes


This a model from the article:  
**Mathematical modelling of prolactin-receptor interaction and the corollary for prolactin receptor gene expression in skin**

**Abstract:**   
A mathematical model of prolactin regulating its own receptors was developed,
and compared with experimental data on a qualitative level. The model
incorporates the kinetics of prolactin-receptor interactions and subsequent
signalling by prolactin-receptor dimers to regulate the production of receptor
mRNA and hence the receptor population. The model relates changes in plasma
prolactin concentration to prolactin receptor (PRLR) gene expression, and can
be used for predictive purposes. The cell signalling that leads to the
activation of target genes, and the mechanisms for regulation of
transcription, were treated empirically in the model. The model's parameters
were adjusted so that model simulations agreed with experimentally observed
responses to administration of prolactin in sheep. In particular, the model
correctly predicts insensitivity of receptor mRNA regulation to a series of
subcutaneous injections of prolactin, versus sensitivity to prolonged infusion
of prolactin. In the latter case, response was an acute down-regulation
followed by a prolonged up-regulation of mRNA, with the magnitude of the up-
regulation increasing with the duration of infusion period. The model
demonstrates the feasibility of predicting the in vivo response of prolactin
target genes to external manipulation of plasma prolactin, and could provide a
useful tool for identifying optimal prolactin treatments for desirable
outcomes.
